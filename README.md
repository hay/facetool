# facetool.py
> Command line utility to manipulate, recognize and detect faces in videos and images, written in Python 3

![Facetool header logo](data/header.gif)

This utility allows you to do all kinds of operations on face images and videos, straight from the command line. Think of it as `ffmpeg` for faces.

Some things `facetool` can do:
* Face swapping
* Face recognition
* Create an average face
* Counting faces
* Cropping faces (even multiple ones from a single image)
* Classifying faces based on age and gender
* Extracting and combining frames from and to videos

## Installation
In theory, this tool should work on any system that can run the required libraries (`dlib`, `opencv` and a couple of other ones), but in practice i've only tested it on MacOS.

### macOS
I highly recommend using [`brew`](https://brew.sh/) to install all dependencies. You'll also need a working version of Python 3.6 or higher.

You can either use [`poetry`](https://poetry.eustace.io/) or install the required libraries globally using `pip`.

Given that you have Python 3.6 on your system this should be enough:

Clone this repository:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hay/facetool.git
```
Install dependencies using `brew`:
```bash
    brew install cmake ffmpeg
```

*When using `poetry` (recommended)*

Run `poetry install` in the root folder of tthe checked out folder. This might take a while! Then run `poetry shell`.

*When using globally installed libraries*

`pip3 install dlib numpy opencv-python ffmpeg-python scikit-image tqdm imutils tensorflow pandas face-recognition`

After installing the libraries (either with or without `poetry`) try running the script by typing `./facetool.py`.

If that all works you can try some of the commands below.

## Examples

### Face swapping on images and video files

Put the features of face.jpg on head.jpg and save the result as swap.jpg

    facetool.py swap -i face.jpg -t head.jpg -o swap.jpg

Put the features of face.jpg on a video file called head.mp4 and save as swap.mp4

    facetool.py swap -i face.jpg -t head.mp4 -o swap.mp4

Put the features of a video file called face.mp4 on another video file called head.mp4 and save as swap.mp4. The audio of `face.mp4` will be used for the output.

    facetool.py swap -i face.mp4 -t head.mp4 -o swap.mp4

Take one 'head' image called `head.jpg` and generate a new faceswap for every file in a directory called `dir-to-face`.

    facetool.py swap -i faces -t head.jpg -o dir-to-face

The other way around: apply the face of `face.jpg` to a directory of `heads` and output to a directory called `face-to-dir`

    facetool.py swap -i face.jpg -t heads -o face-to-dir

When having multiple faces in an input image, select the one you want to use (in the example there are three faces and we want the second face)

    facetool.py swap -i face.jpg -t head.jpg -o swap.jpg -so x,0,x

Put one face on all faces in a target image

    facetool.py swap -i face.jpg -t group.jpg -o swap.jpg -so 0 -sr

Swap two faces in a single image (given that the image has only two faces)

    facetool.py swap -i group.jpg -t group.jpg -o group-swapped.jpg -so 1,0

Only swap nose and mouth

    facetool.py swap -i face.jpg -t head.jpg -o swap.jpg --no-eyesbrows

Only swap eyes and brows

    facetool.py swap -i face.jpg -t head.jpg -o swap.jpg --no-nosemouth

Only swap mouth

    facetool.py swap -i face.jpg -t head.jpg -o swap.jpg --only-mouth

### Face recognition and clustering

Calculate the distance between 'alice.jpg' and a folder full of faces

    facetool.py distance -i alice.jpg -t faces

The same, but then print percentages instead of distance

    facetool.py distance -i alice.jpg -t faces --as-percentage

Save the results to a CSV file instead of printing to the command line

    facetool.py distance -i alice.jpg -t faces --as-percentage -of csv -o results.csv

Encode a path of images and save the encodings to a file called `encodings.json`

    facetool.py encode -i faces -o encodings.json

Use the `encodings.json` file instead of recalculating all the encodings. Note the `-m` (model) switch.

    facetool.py distance -i alice.jpg -m encodings.json

Cluster all faces in a set of images and output a json file

    facetool.py cluster -i faces -o cluster.json

The same, but move the clustered images to a new set of directories

    facetool.py cluster -i faces -o clustered-images

Use an existing .json file (as generated by the `encode` command)

    facetool.py cluster -i encodings.json -o cluster.json

### Face averaging

Create an 'average.jpg' face from a folder of faces

    facetool.py average -i faces -o average.jpg

Do the same thing from a single image that has multiple faces

    facetool.py average -i group.jpg -o average.jpg

You can also average all faces in a video, which will give an interesting, ephemeral effect

    facetool.py average -i face.mp4 -o average.jpg

Save 'original' and 'transformed' averaged faces as well

    facetool.py average -i faces -o average.jpg --save-originals --save-warped

### Classifying age and gender

Get the age and gender of a single image and print to console

    facetool.py classify -i face.jpg

Get the age and gender of all images in a folder and write to a csv file

    facetool.py classify -i faces/ -of csv -o classified.csv

### Face detection, position and cropping

Count the number of faces in `face.jpg`

    facetool.py count -i face.jpg

Count the number of faces in all images in directory `faces`

    facetool.py count -i faces

Show the bounding box of all faces in `face.jpg`

    facetool.py locate -i face.jpg

Create a new image called `face-box.jpg` that draws bounding boxes around all faces in `face.jpg`

    facetool.py locate -i face.jpg -o face.box.jpg

Draw bounding boxes on all faces for all images in directory `faces` and save to `locations`

    facetool.py locate -i faces -o locations

Show the poses of all faces in `face.jpg`

    facetool.py pose -i face.jpg

Create a new image called `face-pose.jpg` that shows the shapes and poses of `face.jpg`

    facetool.py pose -i face.jpg -o face-pose.jpg

Crop all faces from `face.jpg` and save to new files in the directory `cropped`. This will also work with a single image with multiple faces.

    facetool.py crop -i face.jpg -o cropped

### Media utilites
Convert a movie file called `movie.mp4` to a set of JPG files in a directory called `frames` (used for video swapping)

    facetool.py extractframes -i movie.mp4 -o frames

Convert a set of JPG files from the directory `frames` to a movie file called `movie.mp4` (used for video swapping)

    facetool.py combineframes -i frames -o movie.mp4

Combine a WAV file with an existing movie and save to a new one

    facetool.py combineaudio -i movie.mp4 -ai sound.wav -o movie-sound.mp4

Return metadata about an image or video file in JSON format

    facetool.py probe -i movie.mp4

## Troubleshooting
* Before opening an issue, try running your command with the `-v` (verbose) switch, because this will give you more debug information. When using `-vv` (extra verbose) `facetool` will abort the program on exceptions.
* Note that, by default, facetool doesn't stop at errors.
* Documentation might be a bit lacking at times. I try to at least provide one image for every command line switch and option.

## All options
You'll get this output when running `facetool.py -h`.

## Limitations
* More advanced swapping methods like 'deepfake' are not supported.
* Even though you could use the library in your own scripts (instead of using the command line utility), this isn't very well supported yet.
* No multithreading / processor support.
<s>* Face swapping is limited to one face.</s>
<s>* Operations on videos will remove the audio.</s>

## Testing
`facetool` doesn't have a proper test suite yet, but you could try running `test-all.py` in the `test` directory to try a couple of common examples.
